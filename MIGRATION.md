# COBOL to Python Migration Guide

This document explains the process and decisions made during the migration of the legacy COBOL account management system to a modern Python implementation.

## Overview

The original COBOL application consisted of three main files:
- `main.cob`: User interface and main program loop
- `operations.cob`: Account operations (view, credit, debit)
- `data.cob`: Data storage and retrieval

The Python version replicates this structure with:
- `main.py`: Main program logic and user interface
- `src/operations.py`: Account operations as a class
- `src/data_program.py`: Data storage as a class

## Migration Steps

1. **Analysis of COBOL Logic**
   - Identified program flow, data structures, and operations.
   - Mapped COBOL constructs (PERFORM, CALL, MOVE, etc.) to Python equivalents.

2. **Design in Python**
   - Used classes to encapsulate data and operations.
   - Replaced COBOL's procedural flow with Python's object-oriented approach.
   - Used Python's input/output functions for user interaction.

3. **Implementation**
   - Created `DataProgram` class for balance storage and retrieval.
   - Created `Operations` class for account actions (view, credit, debit).
   - Implemented a main loop in `main.py` for user interaction.
   - Added type hints and docstrings for clarity and maintainability.

4. **Testing**
   - Developed unit and functional tests using Python's `unittest` framework.
   - Simulated user input and validated outputs.
   - Used `coverage` to ensure code coverage.

## Key Differences

- **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented**: COBOL is procedural; Python implementation uses classes and methods.
- **Data Handling**: COBOL uses fixed-size fields; Python uses dynamic types and variables.
- **User Interaction**: COBOL uses DISPLAY and ACCEPT; Python uses `print()` and `input()`.
- **Testing**: Python supports automated testing and coverage tools, improving reliability.

## Benefits of Migration

- Improved code readability and maintainability.
- Easier to extend and test.
- Modern tooling and ecosystem support.

## Next Steps

- Further refactor for scalability or integration with databases.
- Add more robust error handling and logging.
- Consider packaging as a module or web service if needed.
